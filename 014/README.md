# LongestCollatzSequence

From [Project Euler: Problem 14](https://projecteuler.net/problem=14)

The Collatz Sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

    n → n/2 (n is even)

    n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)

      i.e. n = 13: 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1

      13 produces a Collatz length of 10

Calculates the number that produces the longest Collatz sequence under one million
